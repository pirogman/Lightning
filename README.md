## Task Description

You are developing an iPhone/iPad (Swift) application that is going to help determine the location of the lighting. There has been quite a lot of lightning in Ukraine lately and sometimes it is necessary to know where they are happening. This application should operate in two models:

- **Sensor** (Peer) - A statically located device with a precise location. The purpose of the sensor is to detect and track loud events.
- **Analyzer** (Host) - The app receives logs and visualizes calculated boom points.
